Acyclic edge-weighted digraph shortest paths 

This is a web application that can be accessed by addressing the web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/graphoptions.  It randomly generates 2-500 vertices in a
Euclidean graph; the edge weights are the distances between vertices.  The graph endpoints, source vertex, and target vertex can be selected.  The path from
the source to the target are displayed in the graph.  The distance of the minimum spanning tree (MST) for the graph as well as the shortest path (SP) are 
shown.
